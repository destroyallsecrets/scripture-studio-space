  mainScripture: {
    text: "These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them. For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error. They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity—for 'people are slaves to whatever has mastered them.' If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them. Of them the proverbs are true: 'A dog returns to its vomit,' and, 'A sow that is washed returns to her wallowing in the mud.'",
    reference: "2 Peter 2:17-22",
    translation: "NIV"
  },
  context: "Peter concludes his description of false teachers by emphasizing the emptiness of their promises and the severity of their fate. He uses vivid natural metaphors to illustrate how these teachers promise spiritual sustenance but deliver nothing. This passage addresses the dangerous appeal of false teaching, particularly to new believers, and the tragic outcome for both the false teachers and those who follow them. Peter's stern warning highlights the serious consequences of abandoning the truth after having known it.",

    "They use impressive, boastful words that are ultimately empty of substance",
    "They specifically target new believers who are just beginning to escape worldly influences",
    "They appeal to fleshly desires rather than spiritual growth",
    "They promise freedom while being enslaved to their own sinful desires",
    "Those who return to sin after knowing Christ are in a worse spiritual condition than before",
    "Peter uses proverbs about animals returning to filth to illustrate the foolishness of returning to sin"

    "Help protect new believers who may be particularly vulnerable to deceptive teaching",
    "Examine whether your own spiritual leaders bear good fruit or merely make empty promises",

    "Cultivate gratitude for genuine spiritual teaching that leads to true freedom"

    "How can we recognize when something is a 'spring without water' in the spiritual sense?",

    "How do false teachers typically 'appeal to lustful desires' today?",
    "What's the difference between the freedom that false teachers promise and the freedom Christ offers?",
    "Why would someone who returns to sin after knowing Christ be 'worse off' than before?",
    "How should we respond to fellow believers who are being drawn in by false teaching?",
