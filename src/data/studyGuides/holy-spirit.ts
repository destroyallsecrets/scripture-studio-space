  context: "Jesus' teaching about the Holy Spirit in John 14-16 came during His final discourse to the disciples before His crucifixion. He was preparing them for His physical absence by promising the coming of the Spirit as 'another Advocate' (parakletos) who would continue His work in and through them. This teaching expanded on Old Testament promises about the Spirit's role in the new covenant and set the stage for the dramatic outpouring at Pentecost that would empower the early church.",
